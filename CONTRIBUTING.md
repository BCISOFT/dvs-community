- **Logs**: Output of `dvs logs` or relevant error messages

### Suggest Features

We love hearing ideas from users. When suggesting a feature:

- **Describe the problem**: What are you trying to accomplish?
- **Propose a solution**: How do you envision it working?
- **Consider alternatives**: Are there other ways to solve this?
- **Provide context**: How would this help your workflow?

## Issue Guidelines

### Before Opening an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
